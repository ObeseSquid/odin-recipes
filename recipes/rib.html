    <h2>Rib</h2>
    <p>
      A tasty prime rib marinade made with olive oil, garlic, and thyme. I was
      trusted with this recipe but I can't keep it to myself!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (10 pound) prime rib roast</li>
      <li>10 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients for marinade.</li>
      <li>
        Mix garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme together in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place roast in a roasting pan with the fatty side up. Spread mixture
        over the top of roast; let roast sit out until it is at room
        temperature, no longer than 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 260 degrees C.</li>
      <li>
        Bake roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; reduce the temperature
        to 165 degrees C, and continue roasting for an additional 60 to 75
        minutes. The internal temperature of the roast should be at 57 degrees C
        for medium rare.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow roast to rest for 10 or 15 minutes before carving so the meat can
        retain its juices.
      </li>
    </ol>
